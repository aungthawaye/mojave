Implement **CommandHandler by referring to the previously implemented **CommandHandler in this package, `org.mojave.core.accounting.domain.command.account`.
Now, create the similar commands inside this package, `org.mojave.core.transaction.domain.command` accordingly
based on its domain/model class in `org.mojave.core.transaction.domain.model`.

You must do the following:
- Analyze the behavior of the domain/model classes and implement the logic accordingly.

You must follow the rules below:
- Use proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Avoid using FQNs whenever importing the classes. Must use the "import" statement.
- Ensure that the controller handles all possible exceptions and errors gracefully.
- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase.
- Use meaningful and descriptive variable types.
- Implement unit tests for the command handlers.
