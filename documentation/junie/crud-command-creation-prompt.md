Create **Command by referring to the previously created **Command in this package, `io.mojaloop.core.accounting.contract.command.account`.
Now, create the similar commands inside this package, `io.mojaloop.core.transaction.contract.command.definition.fundin` accordingly
based on its domain/model class `FundInDefinition`.

You must do the following:
- Analyze the behavior of the domain/model class `FundInDefinition` and create the corresponding command class.
- Create these commands in the `io.mojaloop.core.transaction.contract.command.definition.fundin` package.

You must follow the rules below:
- Use proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Avoid using FQNs whenever importing the classes. Must use the "import" statement.
- Ensure that the controller handles all possible exceptions and errors gracefully.
- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase.
- Use meaningful and descriptive variable types.
