# Mojave

**Mojave** is an open-source, interoperable **Instant Payment Switch** implemented in Java.

Inspired by [Mojaloop](https://mojaloop.io/), Mojave currently follows the **FSPIOP** specification, with **ISO 20022** support planned on the roadmap.

Mojave is designed with two primary goals:

1. **Practical foundation** – Provide a simple, production-oriented foundation for building an instant payment switch.
2. **Learning platform** – Serve as a reference implementation for understanding how instant payment systems are designed and implemented end-to-end.
